                <p>As a first time traveler, I was very nervous. I had never been outside the United States before, and now I was going to spend an entire semester in a different country. Hands down, it was one if the best decisions I have ever made. The city of Dublin was big and filled with so many amazing pubs and cute thrift shops. The city life was just as beautiful as the the nature.</p>

                <p>DCU was the first uni to repond and they were so nice and helpful that I liked them immediately. I never experienced such nice people, who were helpful and made me feel welcome. Even though I was told, my chances of getting a room on campus were non-existent, I applied and, to my surprise, I received an answer shortly. I was offered a more expensive room on the post-grad complex.</p>
